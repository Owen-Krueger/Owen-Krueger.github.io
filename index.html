		<h1>How Did I Get Here??</h1>
		<p>I grew up in Mora, Minnesota, on a small cattle farm. Most of my childhood 
		was spent on the farm, and I worked for my grandfather on his farm throughout 
		my high school career. I attended Mora High School and graduated in spring of 
		2015.</p>
		<h2>College of Saint Scholastica</h2>
		<img src="res/CSS_Tower_Hall.jpg"/>
		<p>I received my bachelors degree from the College of Saint Scholastica in 
		May of 2019 in Computer Science/Computer Information Systems with a concentration 
		in Software Development. During my time at CSS, I participated in the Computer 
		Club and the Earth Action Club. I was the vice president of the Earth Action 
		Club during my sophomore year and a co-president with another student during my 
		junior and senior years. Also while I was at school, I worked as a computer 
		science tutor in the on-campus Tutoring Center during my sophomore through senior 
		years. I was the lead tutor during both my junior and senior years. On top of my 
		tutoring job, I also worked as a tech services assistant, where I worked with the 
		staff on campus for most of their tech/computer needs. I worked that job from 
		spring of my sophomore year to the end of my senior year.</p>
		<h2>Life In Duluth</h2>
		<img src="res/Mesabi_Miner.jpg"/>
		<p>Living in Duluth, I was able to enjoy the many things that Duluth had to offer. 
		I have always had a great interest in the shipping industry, and I could 
		frequently be found hanging around Canal Park, looking at the ships coming and 
		going through the Lift Bridge. I also enjoyed the many walking and skiing trails 
		that populated the Duluth hills.</p>
